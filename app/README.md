# OpenPets desktop renderer (Phase 1)

A lightweight Tauri 2 desktop app that animates any Codex-format pet atlas
on your screen — independent of Codex CLI.

> ✅ **Status**: Phase 1 working. Pet renders in a transparent always-on-top
> window, **stays visible across every Space including other apps' full-screen
> Spaces**, can be dragged with the mouse, and clicks trigger the wave
> animation. macOS-first; Windows / Linux planned once the macOS path is
> battle-tested.

## What it does today

- Reads pet packages from `~/.codex/pets/*/` (same layout the Codex CLI uses)
- Renders the 192×208 sprite cells from the WebP atlas in a transparent,
  always-on-top, undecorated window
- Plays the canonical 9-state animation cycle (idle / running-right /
  running-left / waving / jumping / failed / waiting / running / review)
  defined by the [open-pet-creator Skill](../open-pet-creator/SKILL.md)
- **Floats over full-screen apps** (Safari fullscreen, Final Cut, Xcode
  fullscreen, etc.) and follows the user across Mission Control Spaces
- **Drag the pet** to move it; **click** (without drag) to play the wave
  animation
- Tray icon menu → `Quit`

## Roadmap (Phase 2)

- External event source — let Codex / Claude Code / Cursor drive pet states
  via a local socket or file watcher (e.g., AI is generating → `running`,
  test failed → `failed`, task done → `waving`)
- Pet picker UI in tray menu (currently loads the first pet alphabetically)
- Click-through on transparent pixels (so the window doesn't intercept
  clicks on its empty edges; needs sprite-bbox hit-testing)
- Multi-pet support, drag-to-position memory, settings panel
- Cross-platform parity (Linux / Windows)

## Prerequisites

- **Rust** — install via `rustup`:
  ```bash
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
  ```
- **Node.js 20+** (you already have this if `npm --version` works)
- **Xcode Command Line Tools** (macOS):
  ```bash
  xcode-select --install
  ```

## Run in dev mode

From this directory (`app/`):

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The first build takes a few minutes (Cargo compiles Tauri + WebKit bindings).
Subsequent runs are fast.

You should see a small transparent window in the **bottom-right** of your
screen with the first pet (alphabetically by id) under `~/.codex/pets/*/`
animating.

## Build a release `.app`

```bash
npm run build
```

Output:

```text
app/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/OpenPets.app
app/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/dmg/OpenPets_0.1.0_aarch64.dmg
```

Bundle size is typically **~5 MB** thanks to using the system WebKit
(no Chromium bundled).

```

## How it stays lightweight

- Vanilla HTML / CSS / JS for the frontend (no React, no bundler)
- `withGlobalTauri: true` exposes `window.__TAURI__` so the JS side imports
  zero npm packages at runtime — just calls `invoke()` and `convertFileSrc()`
- Three Rust deps total: `tauri`, `serde`, and (macOS-only) `objc 0.2`
- Release profile uses `lto = true`, `opt-level = "s"`, `strip = true`

## macOS implementation notes

The two non-trivial pieces of the macOS implementation are documented here
because they took several iterations to get right and the path forward
through the docs is misleading.

### Why we promote the NSWindow to NSPanel at runtime

Tauri (via `tao`) creates the window as a plain `NSWindow`. For a desktop
pet to be useful we need it visible **everywhere on the desktop, including
on top of other apps' full-screen Spaces**. We tried the obvious approach
first:

1. `alwaysOnTop: true` in tauri.conf.json
   → sets `NSFloatingWindowLevel` (= 3). Fine for normal apps; ignored when
   another app is full-screen.
2. `set_visible_on_all_workspaces(true)` from the Tauri API
   → sets `NSWindowCollectionBehaviorCanJoinAllSpaces`. Necessary but not
   sufficient: the window's `isOnActiveSpace` reads `true`, but it still
   doesn't render over other apps' full-screen Spaces on macOS 13+.
3. Bumping the level to `NSScreenSaverWindowLevel` (= 1000) + adding
   `fullScreenAuxiliary` and `stationary` flags
   → still doesn't show over a full-screen app.

The actual blocker is the **window's class**: a regular `NSWindow` is
simply not allowed by the macOS window server to overlay another app's
full-screen Space, regardless of flags or level. The class that *is*
allowed is `NSPanel` (with `NSWindowStyleMaskNonactivatingPanel` set).
This is what apps like Bartender, Stickies, BetterDisplay, and tauri-nspanel
all do.

We swap the class in place with the Objective-C runtime's `object_setClass`:

```rust
// objc 0.2 doesn't bind this C runtime function — declare it manually.
extern "C" {
    fn object_setClass(obj: *mut Object, cls: *const Class) -> *const Class;
}

let panel_class: &Class = class!(NSPanel);
unsafe { object_setClass(ns_window, panel_class as *const Class) };

// Then add the panel-specific style mask bit (1 << 7 = 128).
let style_mask: u64 = unsafe { msg_send![ns_window, styleMask] };
let new_style_mask = style_mask | 128;
unsafe { let _: () = msg_send![ns_window, setStyleMask: new_style_mask]; }
```

`object_setClass` is safe here because `NSPanel` is a direct subclass of
`NSWindow`: the object's memory layout doesn't change, only its method
dispatch. After the swap, the `NSWindowStyleMaskNonactivatingPanel` style
bit becomes meaningful, the window-server treats the window as a panel,
and overlaying full-screen Spaces just works.

### The collection-behavior + level still matters

Even after the class swap, set:

- `collectionBehavior = canJoinAllSpaces (1) | stationary (16) | ignoresCycle (64) | fullScreenAuxiliary (256)` = `337`
- `level = NSScreenSaverWindowLevel (1000)`

These flags are reapplied on every `Focused(true)` window event because
some macOS versions silently reset them when the window crosses into a
new Space.

### Drag uses an explicit Rust command, not `data-tauri-drag-region`

The `data-tauri-drag-region` attribute interacts oddly with
`macOSPrivateApi: true` + `transparent: true` + a canvas element, so we
expose a `start_drag` Tauri command and invoke it from `mousedown` in JS.
A clean press without movement still emits the `click` event (→ wave); a
press with movement starts an OS-native window drag.

## Troubleshooting

**No pet appears.** The window might be off-screen or behind another window.
Check the console (`tauri dev` shows logs) for `OpenPets: no pets found …`.
Install at least one pet first:

```bash
# Either via Petdex
npx petdex install phrolova

# Or manually copy from this repo
mkdir -p ~/.codex/pets/phrolova
cp ../pets/phrolova/spritesheet.webp ~/.codex/pets/phrolova/
cp ../pets/phrolova/pet.json         ~/.codex/pets/phrolova/
```

**Wrong pet shows up.** The current MVP loads the first pet alphabetically
by id. To change which one shows, rename or remove other pet directories
under `~/.codex/pets/` until your preferred one sorts first. Tray-menu
selection lands in Phase 2.

**Pet not visible over a full-screen app.** Check the dev console output
for the line `[OpenPets] after: behavior=337 level=1000 styleMask=128 …`.
If `styleMask` is missing the `128` bit, the NSPanel class swap failed —
typically because Tauri or tao moved the NSWindow under a class that's
not a direct subclass of NSWindow. Open an issue with the dev log.

**Build fails with "linker error" on macOS.** Run `xcode-select --install`
to ensure command-line tools are present.

**Tray icon missing.** Tauri's tray support requires macOS 10.15+. Verify
with `sw_vers`.

**Compiler warnings about `unexpected_cfg`.** These come from the old
`objc 0.2` macros and are harmless. We suppress them via
`#![allow(unexpected_cfgs)]` at the top of `src/main.rs`.
